I work on computer vision and machine learning problems. I enjoy building the product that can scale, while doing applied research and occasionally publishing.

Most recently, I am involved in Google's large multimodal generative model development, a.k.a., [Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#introduction), with an focus on fine-tuning and its various downstream applications. Prior to that, I designed and [optimized](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2022/06/Adding-Quantization-aware-Training-and-Pruning-to-the-TensorFlow-Model-Garden.html) vision models for various Google products, such as [Photos](https://blog.google/products/photos/magic-eraser-android-ios-google-one/), [AR Core](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/scene-semantics) and [Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/model-garden), etc., created the first anomaly detection models behind [Google Cloud Inspection AI](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/improve-manufacturing-quality-control-with-visual-inspection-ai), and built image search from the ground up for [eBay's first conversational chatbot](https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/say-hello-to-ebay-shopbot-beta/).

I also spent great time as a research intern at [NEC Labs](https://www.nec-labs.com/research/media-analytics/) and [SRI International](https://www.sri.com/research/information-computing-sciences/computer-vision/).

I obtained my Ph.D in Computer Science from the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://umd.edu/), advised by [Prof. Larry S. Davis](https://www.umiacs.umd.edu/people/lsd). I was also affiliated with the [University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS)](https://www.umiacs.umd.edu/). Before that, I obtained my Master in Information Processing from [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Huchuan Lu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=D3nE0agAAAAJ&hl=en).
